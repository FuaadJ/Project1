# Projects



**Project 1**

The Training2.ipynb contains the training environment for the neural network, enabling it to trade within the OMXS30 market using deep reinforcement learning. Through continuous feedback loops and autonomous exploration, the model refines its strategies, adapting to market dynamics and optimizing decision-making. This immersive learning experience nurtures the neural network into a strategic trader, proficient in risk management and seizing opportunities amidst the complexities of the OMXS30 market.

The Evaluation1.ipynb encapsulates the identical environment, but now it presents information through plots and data for evaluation purposes. To assess the neural network's performance, TensorBoard proves to be an invaluable tool, empowering comprehensive analysis and visualization of key metrics.
Within the Final_result_1_2016, you can observe the displayed outcomes for three distinct methods, the training data used was between 2010-2015 and the displayed result is between 2016-2019.

**Project 2**
Movie Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline

This Python script is an example of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts movie data from a CSV file and loads it into a MySQL database. It is designed to handle movie titles and release years stored in the CSV file.

Prerequisites

Before using this ETL script, ensure that you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    mysql-connector-python library (install via pip install mysql-connector-python)
